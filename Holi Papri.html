<h2>
  <u>  Ingredients :</u> <br>
  1/2 kg besan.<br>
  1 tsp mustard oil.<br>
  1 tsp(heaped) salt<br>
  1 small tsp red chilli powder<br>
  1 cup water<br>
  1 tsp methi leaves.(chopped fine)<br>
  1/4 kg maida.<br>


</h2>
<h2>
   <u> Method:</u><br>
   Mix besan, salt, red chilli powder and oil well. Knead the mixture into dough. Knead for about five minutes. Add the methi <br>leaves. Knead for another three minutes. Make the dough into a big round ball and throw the dough on the plate to soften it. <br>This should be done for about seven minutes.<br><br>

   Heat oil in a deep-frying pan, on very high heat. While oil is heating, rub some oil on your palm and roll out the dough into a <br>long strip about one inch thick. Cut the roll into inch size pieces. Keep rubbing oil on your palms to keep the roll moist. <br>Flatten each piece out into a round shape and roll it into small chapatis. Lightly dust both sides of the small chapatis or <br>papris with maida.<br><br>
   
   Fry very lightly, turning the flame from medium to low as required. Do not let the papris turn brown or red. They should look <br>golden yellow when ready. Drain oil and store in an airtight container.<br>
