    History of Holi<br><br>
The festival marks the event of when Prahlada, the son of a demon king but a devotee of Hindu god Vishnu, was saved after his own<br> father tried to get him killed for his devotion to the god.<br> His father laid Prahlada in his sister Holika's lap. Holika was blessed to not get <br>hurt by fire.Holi also celebrates the Hindu god Krishna and the legend of Holika and Prahlad. Hiranyakashipu<br> was an evil king. He had special powers that made him nearly invincible and he wanted everyone in his kingdom to worship him. He was so powerful <br>he started to act like a god and punished or killed anyone who disobeyed him.<br><br>How did Holi start in India?<br>
The festival, although celebrated for two days across the country, started a month ago in Vrindavan, where women played Lathmar Holi, loosely translated to “beating with sticks”, <br>as they chased men with sticks — a recreation of Krishna and Radha's frolics.
