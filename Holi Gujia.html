<h2>
  <u>  Ingredients :</u> <br>
  Ingredients :<br>
  500 gms maida (flour)<br>
  1kg khoya<br>
  3tbsps kismis (raisins)<br>
  200 gms almonds (cut into thin strips)<br>
  6 tbsps cooking oil. ( keep some more aside for deep frying)<br>
  200 ml water.<br>
  500 gms sugar.<br>
  <h2>
   <u>Method</u>
    Mix six tablespoons of oil with maida. Using fingers, mix well so that the mixture takes the form of breadcrumbs and binds to a <br>certain extent. Now add some water and knead lightly. Keep adding water as required and knead into a soft dough. Set aside <br>and cover with a damp cloth.<br>
    Put the khoya in a deep-frying pan and fry to a light brown colour. Add sugar into the khoya and mix well. Add almonds and <br>kismis. Fry for a few minutes and remove from the fire. Let it cool.<br>
    Roll out the kneaded dough into a chapati, thicker and smaller than a normal chapati. Fill half the chapati with the khoya <br>mixture, fold the chapati and seal the round, twisting the edges inwards. Take care that the filling does not ooze out.<br><br>
    
    Deep fry these gujjias, a few at a time, till they are a deep golden brown. Fry on a slow fire. When done, take them out with a <br>sieve type ladle, draining the oil completely. Let them drain further on a spread out newspaper, till all the grease is <br>soaked up.<br>
    Store in an airtight glass jar.
